# PSXUIPC

An FSUIPC-compatible interface for the Aerowinx PSX 747 simulator.

This is intended to provide the most common offsets to make flight trackers, virtual airline ACARS programs etc. work with PSX standalone (i.e. not coupled to FSX/P3D/MSFS/X-Plane). Because of this, the interface is read-only at the moment and does not provide the functionality to let external software change PSX-Variables through PSXUIPC.
